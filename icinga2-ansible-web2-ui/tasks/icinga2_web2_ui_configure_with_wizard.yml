# We likely don't want to run this setup twice since it can mess up any configuration you may have done from the UI.
# So the idea is to check if we have a user created in the DB, if it is the case then we skip the setup.
# We can force to reinstate with extra_vars icinga2_web2_setup_reinstate=true, but at your own risk, really!

# When setup is done we supposed to have a user created. Let's check that:
- include: icinga2_web2_ui_get_icingaweb_user.yml

- name: Create Icinga token
  become: yes
  command: icingacli setup token create
  args:
    creates: "{{ icinga2_web2_conf_dir }}/setup.token"
  when: icingaweb_user_does_not_exist

- name: Icinga Web2 Installation finished (RH)
  debug: msg="Now go at http://IP/icingaweb2/setup to continue the installation"
